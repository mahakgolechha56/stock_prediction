Stock price prediction

Here's an overview of a stock price forecasting project

**1. Project Overview**  
In this project, the goal was to predict stock prices based on historical data, which includes features such as past stock prices, trading volumes, and external factor sentiment. The main objective was to develop a machine learning model capable of forecasting the future price of a given stock or a set of stocks.  

Key objectives:
- Use historical stock data to train a machine learning model.
- Create a model that can predict future stock prices.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

**2. Thought Process**  
The thought process for this project would involve several key steps:

  **a. Data Collection & Exploration:**  
  - The stock price was scraped via Yahoo Finance and news data was scraped via dataset from Kaggle.  
  - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the features, detect trends, check for seasonality, and find any correlations between the stock price and other factors (like volume, open, high, low, etc.).  

  **b. Feature Engineering:**  
  - Performed sentiment analysis on all the content each day. Since there were multiple news articles for a day, an average score was computed, and the corresponding sentiment was deducted from this score. This was used as one of the features.  
  - Incorporated time-related features such as month, and end of quarter, as these may have a significant impact on stock prices.  

**3. Model Selection:**  
- The **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)** model was selected because of its lightweight nature and its ease in handling features. It can handle temporal features well.

**4. Challenges Faced**  
Several challenges were faced during the development of a stock price forecasting model:
- Stock data had missing values, and cleaning and preprocessing the data was time-consuming.
- Data related to it was available easily for only one company. Ideally, data would be needed for more companies to understand the performance or impact of sentiments or have a global model for all.
- Identifying the right set of features is crucial. Technical indicators may be important, but deciding which ones are most relevant and avoiding overfitting was difficult due to limited data.
- Incorporating factors such as market sentiment, geopolitical events, or global economic shifts is complex. Currently, only direct news related to the company was available in the data, but not geopolitical or global economic news.

**5. Result Interpretation**  
Once the model is trained and tested, the results were interpreted:
- The model is able to predict quite well for most days. It was able to cover the spikes and dips. 
- From the plots, it's clearly seen that on the 11th or 12th of every month, the sales are higher than predicted. This could be due to various factors related to company policies, sales, global news, etc.

**6. Next Steps**  
The next steps after completing the project include:

  **a. Improving the Model:**  
  - Experiment with more complex algorithms such as **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, which can learn temporal dependencies better.  
  - Tune hyperparameters for better performance using techniques like **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**.  
  - Incorporate external data like global financial news, social media feeds, etc., to improve predictions.  
  - Including various stocks in the data and then creating a global time series model might perform even better.  

  **b. Model Validation:**  
  - Implement **cross-validation** (or **walk-forward validation**) to assess model performance and ensure robustness.  
  - Test the model on unseen market conditions to verify its generalization capability.

  **c. Testing on Other Stocks:**  
  - After testing on one stock or sector, test the model on a different stock or multiple stocks to assess generalizability.

**7. Deployment Considerations**  
When deploying the model, here are a few things to keep in mind:

  **a. Forecast Pipeline:**  
  - Build a pipeline that includes SQL queries to ingest data from the data source, perform data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and then saving the model for generating forecasts.  
  - This would help retrain the model regularly (monthly, yearly, etc.) using updated data to ensure the model remains relevant.

  **b. Performance Monitoring:**  
  - Monitor the modelâ€™s performance in real-time to detect any significant drop in predictive accuracy.  
  - Implement a system to flag predictions that deviate significantly from actual values.  
  - Create dashboards to help analyze the results.

  **c. Deployment Environment:**  
  - Choose the right platform to deploy the model (e.g., cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).  
  - Set up APIs or web services for easy access to the predictions.

  **d. Scaling:**  
  - Use parallel processing and optimize the model to handle large-scale data efficiently.  
  - Create a global model to predict multiple stocks as this would reduce the number of models to be maintained.
